I have started to move my blogs from [MSDN][MSDN-Link] over to [Github Pages][GithubPages-Link] slowly, I feel it is more appropriate considering some of my posts are personal in nature.

I have been looking at different options to host my blogs since a few months ago, from fully managed sites like Medium, or Blogspot to blog CMS like Ghost or Wordpress, which I have to eventually find a way to host them.

Finally settled with the following:

## Github pages

Finnaly settled down with Github Pages. Simply put, this Github Pages and Jekyll allow me to continue to write blogs with minimal (almost none) cost while giving me full control of my contents. Most importantly, I can now write my entries using tools that I like.
